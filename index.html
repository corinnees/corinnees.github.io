<h2> <strong> Student at University of Missouri-Columbia | Educator at lululemon | Economics Major </strong> </h2>

<body> 

<p> I am a senior at the University of Missouri studying Economics, Business, and Textile and Apparel Management.
  I have worked in retail, most recently at lululemon, developing my leadership, collaboration, communication, and tactical skills pertaining to retail operations. 
  I have also worked in an office setting at both the Department of Economics within the University and for a financial advisor. 
  These experiences have helped cultivate skills such as working with excel, organization, and client communications. 
  I am currently exploring many career paths and am open to opportunities in a variety of fields. </p>
